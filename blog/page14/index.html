  <p>I&#39;ll start by answering the obvious question:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What happened to 0.6 and 0.7?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s become increasingly obvious since our launch in May that people want to use React on the server. With the server-side rendering abilities, that&#39;s a perfect fit. However using the same copy of React on the server and then packaging it up for the client is surprisingly a harder problem. People have been using our <code>react-tools</code> module which includes React, but when browserifying that ends up packaging all of <code>esprima</code> and some other dependencies that aren&#39;t needed on the client. So we wanted to make this whole experience better.</p>

<p>We talked with <a href="https://github.com/jeffbski">Jeff Barczewski</a> who was the owner of the <code>react</code> module on npm. He was kind enough to transition ownership to us and release his package under a different name: <code>autoflow</code>. I encourage you to <a href="https://github.com/jeffbski/autoflow">check it out</a> if you&#39;re writing a lot of asynchronous code. In order to not break all of <code>react</code>&#39;s current users of 0.7.x, we decided to bump our version to 0.8 and skip the issue entirely. We&#39;re also including a warning if you use our <code>react</code> module like you would use the previous package.</p>

<p>In order to make the transition to 0.8 for our current users as painless as possible, we decided to make 0.8 primarily a bug fix release on top of 0.5. No public APIs were changed (even if they were already marked as deprecated). We haven&#39;t added any of the new features we have in master, though we did take the opportunity to pull in some improvements to internals.</p>

<p>We hope that by releasing <code>react</code> on npm, we will enable a new set of uses that have been otherwise difficult. All feedback is welcome!</p>

  <p>Today we&#39;re releasing an update to address a potential XSS vulnerability that can    arise when using user data as a <code>key</code>. Typically &quot;safe&quot; data is used for a <code>key</code>, for example, an id from your database, or a unique hash. However there are cases where it may be reasonable to use user generated content. A carefully crafted piece of content could result in arbitrary JS execution. While we make a very concerted effort to ensure all text is escaped before inserting it into the DOM, we missed one case. Immediately following the discovery of this vulnerability, we performed an audit to ensure we this was the only such vulnerability.</p>

<p>This only affects v0.5.x and v0.4.x. Versions in the 0.3.x family are unaffected.</p>

<p>Updated versions are available for immediate download via npm, bower, and on our <a href="/react/downloads.html">download page</a>.</p>

<p>We take security very seriously at Facebook. For most of our products, users don&#39;t need to know that a security issue has been fixed. But with libraries like React, we need to make sure developers using React have access to fixes to keep their users safe.</p>

<p>While we&#39;ve encouraged responsible disclosure as part of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/whitehat/">Facebook&#39;s whitehat bounty program</a> since we launched, we don&#39;t have a good process for notifying our users. Hopefully we don&#39;t need to use it, but moving forward we&#39;ll set up a little bit more process to ensure the safety of our users. Ember.js has <a href="http://emberjs.com/security/">an excellent policy</a> which we may use as our model.</p>

<p>You can learn more about the vulnerability discussed here: <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/reactjs/OIqxlB2aGfU">CVE-2013-7035</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.pixelingene.com/">Pavan Podila</a> wrote an in-depth introduction to React on TutsPlus. This is definitively worth reading.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Within a component-tree, data should always flow down. A parent-component should set the props of a child-component to pass any data from the parent to the child. This is termed as the Owner-Owned pair. On the other hand user-events (mouse, keyboard, touches) will always bubble up from the child all the way to the root component, unless handled in between.

<p>In a nutshell, I presented why we chose React among other available options (ember.js, angular, backbone ...) in AgFlow, where I’m leading an application development.</p>

<p>During the talk a wanted to highlight that React is not about implementing a Model, but a way to construct visible components with some state. React is simple. It is super simple, you can learn it in 1h. On the other hand what is model? Which functionality it should provide? React does one thing and does it the best (for me)!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lets start with the elephant in the room: JSX?
Is this some sort of template language? Specifically no. This might have been the first big stumbling block. What looks like to be a templating language is actually an in-line DSL that gets transpiled directly into JavaScript by the JSX transpiler.</p>

<p>Creating elements in memory is quick -- copying those elements into the DOM is where the slowness occurs. This is due to a variety of issues, most namely reflow/paint. Changing the items in the DOM causes the browser to re-paint the display, apply styles, etc. We want to keep those operations to an absolute minimum, especially if we&#39;re dealing with something that needs to update the DOM frequently.</p>

  <p>This is the 10th round-up already and React has come quite far since it was open sourced. Almost all new web projects at Khan Academy, Facebook, and Instagram are being developed using React. React has been deployed in a variety of contexts: a Chrome extension, a Windows 8 application, mobile websites, and desktop websites supporting Internet Explorer 8! Language-wise, React is not only being used within JavaScript but also CoffeeScript and ClojureScript.</p>

<p>The best part is that no drastic changes have been required to support all those use cases. Most of the efforts were targeted at polishing edge cases, performance improvements, and documentation.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" name="khan-academy---officially-moving-to-react"></a>Khan Academy - Officially moving to React <a class="hash-link" href="#khan-academy---officially-moving-to-react">#</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://joelburget.com/">Joel Burget</a> announced at Hack Reactor that new front-end code at Khan Academy should be written in React!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How did we get the rest of the team to adopt React? Using interns as an attack vector! Most full-time devs had already been working on their existing projects for a while and weren&#39;t looking to try something new at the time, but our class of summer interns was just arriving. For whatever reason, a lot of them decided to try React for their projects. Then mentors became exposed through code reviews or otherwise touching the new code. In this way React knowledge diffused to almost the whole team over the summer.</p>

<p>Since the first React checkin on June 5, we&#39;ve somehow managed to accumulate 23500 lines of jsx (React-flavored js) code. Which is terrifying in a way - that&#39;s a lot of code - but also really exciting that it was picked up so quickly.</p>

<p>We held three meetings about how we should proceed with React. At the first two we decided to continue experimenting with React and deferred a final decision on whether to adopt it. At the third we adopted the policy that new code should be written in React.</p>

<p>I&#39;m excited that we were able to start nudging code quality forward. However, we still have a lot of work to do! One of the selling points of this transition is adopting a uniform frontend style. We&#39;re trying to upgrade all the code from (really old) pure jQuery and (regular old) Backbone views / Handlebars to shiny React. At the moment all we&#39;ve done is introduce more fragmentation. We won&#39;t be gratuitously updating working code (if it ain&#39;t broke, don&#39;t fix it), but are seeking out parts of the codebase where we can shoot two birds with one stone by rewriting in React while fixing bugs or adding functionality.</p>

<p>Webkit has a <a href="https://github.com/WebKit/webkit/tree/master/PerformanceTests/DoYouEvenBench">TodoMVC Benchmark</a> that compares different frameworks. They recently included React and here are the results (average of 10 runs in Chrome 30):</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="cm">/**</span>
<span class="cm"> * This is a completely optional performance enhancement that you can implement</span>
<span class="cm"> * on any React component. If you were to delete this method the app would still</span>
<span class="cm"> * work correctly (and still be very performant!), we just use it as an example</span>
<span class="cm"> * of how little code it takes to get an order of magnitude performance improvement.</span>
<span class="cm"> */</span>
<span class="nx">shouldComponentUpdate</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">nextProps</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">nextState</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="nx">nextProps</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">todo</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">id</span> <span class="o">!==</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">props</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">todo</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">id</span> <span class="o">||</span>
    <span class="nx">nextProps</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">todo</span> <span class="o">!==</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">props</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">todo</span> <span class="o">||</span>
    <span class="nx">nextProps</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">editing</span> <span class="o">!==</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">props</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">editing</span> <span class="o">||</span>
    <span class="nx">nextState</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">editText</span> <span class="o">!==</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">state</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">editText</span>
  <span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">},</span>

<p>By default, React &quot;re-renders&quot; all the components when anything changes. This is usually fast enough that you don&#39;t need to care. However, you can provide a function that can tell whether there will be any change based on the previous and next states and props. If it is faster than re-rendering the component, then you get a performance improvement.</p>

<p>The fact that you can control when components are rendered is a very important characteristic of React as it gives you control over its performance. We are going to talk more about performance in the future, stay tuned.</p>

<p><a href="http://conr.me">Connor McSheffrey</a> implemented a small game using React. The goal is to guess which filter has been used to create the Instagram photo.

<h2><a class="anchor" name="react-vs-fruitmachine"></a>React vs FruitMachine <a class="hash-link" href="#react-vs-fruitmachine">#</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://trib.tv/">Andrew Betts</a>, director of the <a href="http://labs.ft.com/">Financial Times Labs</a>, posted an article comparing <a href="https://github.com/ftlabs/fruitmachine">FruitMachine</a> and React.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Eerily similar, no? Maybe Facebook was inspired by Fruit Machine (after all, we got there first), but more likely, it just shows that this is a pretty decent way to solve the problem, and great minds think alike. We&#39;re graduating to a third phase in the evolution of web best practice - from intermingling of markup, style and behaviour, through a phase in which those concerns became ever more separated and encapsulated, and finally to a model where we can do that separation at a component level. Developments like Web Components show the direction the web community is moving, and frameworks like React and Fruit Machine are in fact not a lot more than polyfills for that promised behaviour to come.</p>

<p>Even though we weren&#39;t inspired by FruitMachine (React has been used in production since before FruitMachine was open sourced), it&#39;s great to see similar technologies emerging and becoming popular.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" name="react-brunch"></a>React Brunch <a class="hash-link" href="#react-brunch">#</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://elucidata.net/">Matthew McCray</a> implemented <a href="https://npmjs.org/package/react-brunch">react-brunch</a>, a JSX compilation step for <a href="http://brunch.io/">Brunch</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Adds React support to brunch by automatically compiling <code>*.jsx</code> files.</p>

<p>You can configure react-brunch to automatically insert a react header (<code>/** @jsx React.DOM */</code>) into all <code>*.jsx</code> files. Disabled by default.</p>

<p>Install the plugin via npm with <code>npm install --save react-brunch</code>.</p>
