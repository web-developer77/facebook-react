  <p>Today we&#39;re releasing an update to address a potential XSS vulnerability that can    arise when using user data as a <code>key</code>. Typically &quot;safe&quot; data is used for a <code>key</code>, for example, an id from your database, or a unique hash. However there are cases where it may be reasonable to use user generated content. A carefully crafted piece of content could result in arbitrary JS execution. While we make a very concerted effort to ensure all text is escaped before inserting it into the DOM, we missed one case. Immediately following the discovery of this vulnerability, we performed an audit to ensure we this was the only such vulnerability.</p>

<p>This only affects v0.5.x and v0.4.x. Versions in the 0.3.x family are unaffected.</p>

<p>Updated versions are available for immediate download via npm, bower, and on our <a href="/react/downloads.html">download page</a>.</p>

<p>We take security very seriously at Facebook. For most of our products, users don&#39;t need to know that a security issue has been fixed. But with libraries like React, we need to make sure developers using React have access to fixes to keep their users safe.</p>

<p>While we&#39;ve encouraged responsible disclosure as part of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/whitehat/">Facebook&#39;s whitehat bounty program</a> since we launched, we don&#39;t have a good process for notifying our users. Hopefully we don&#39;t need to use it, but moving forward we&#39;ll set up a little bit more process to ensure the safety of our users. Ember.js has <a href="http://emberjs.com/security/">an excellent policy</a> which we may use as our model.</p>

<p>You can learn more about the vulnerability discussed here: <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/reactjs/OIqxlB2aGfU">CVE-2013-7035</a>.</p>

<h2>Intro to the React Framework</h2>

<p><a href="http://blog.pixelingene.com/">Pavan Podila</a> wrote an in-depth introduction to React on TutsPlus. This is definitively worth reading.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Within a component-tree, data should always flow down. A parent-component should set the props of a child-component to pass any data from the parent to the child. This is termed as the Owner-Owned pair. On the other hand user-events (mouse, keyboard, touches) will always bubble up from the child all the way to the root component, unless handled in between.

<h2>140-characters textarea</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/brainkim">Brian Kim</a> wrote a small textarea component that gradually turns red as you reach the 140-characters limit. Because he only changes the background color, React is smart enough not to mess with the text selection.</p>

<h2>AgFlow Talk</h2>

<p><a href="http://rz.scale-it.pl/">Robert Zaremba</a> working on <a href="http://www.agflow.com/">AgFlow</a> recently talked in Poland about React.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a nutshell, I presented why we chose React among other available options (ember.js, angular, backbone ...) in AgFlow, where Iâ€™m leading an application development.</p>

<p>During the talk a wanted to highlight that React is not about implementing a Model, but a way to construct visible components with some state. React is simple. It is super simple, you can learn it in 1h. On the other hand what is model? Which functionality it should provide? React does one thing and does it the best (for me)!</p>

<h2>JSX</h2>

<p><a href="http://tck.io/">Todd Kennedy</a> working at Cond&eacute; Nast wrote <a href="https://github.com/CondeNast/JSXHint">JSXHint</a> and explains in a blog post his perspective on JSX.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lets start with the elephant in the room: JSX?
Is this some sort of template language? Specifically no. This might have been the first big stumbling block. What looks like to be a templating language is actually an in-line DSL that gets transpiled directly into JavaScript by the JSX transpiler.</p>

<p>Creating elements in memory is quick -- copying those elements into the DOM is where the slowness occurs. This is due to a variety of issues, most namely reflow/paint. Changing the items in the DOM causes the browser to re-paint the display, apply styles, etc. We want to keep those operations to an absolute minimum, especially if we&#39;re dealing with something that needs to update the DOM frequently.</p>

<div class="post">
  <p>This is the 10th round-up already and React has come quite far since it was open sourced. Almost all new web projects at Khan Academy, Facebook, and Instagram are being developed using React. React has been deployed in a variety of contexts: a Chrome extension, a Windows 8 application, mobile websites, and desktop websites supporting Internet Explorer 8! Language-wise, React is not only being used within JavaScript but also CoffeeScript and ClojureScript.</p>

<p>The best part is that no drastic changes have been required to support all those use cases. Most of the efforts were targeted at polishing edge cases, performance improvements, and documentation.</p>

<h2>Khan Academy - Officially moving to React</h2>

<p><a href="http://joelburget.com/">Joel Burget</a> announced at Hack Reactor that new front-end code at Khan Academy should be written in React!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How did we get the rest of the team to adopt React? Using interns as an attack vector! Most full-time devs had already been working on their existing projects for a while and weren&#39;t looking to try something new at the time, but our class of summer interns was just arriving. For whatever reason, a lot of them decided to try React for their projects. Then mentors became exposed through code reviews or otherwise touching the new code. In this way React knowledge diffused to almost the whole team over the summer.</p>

<p>Since the first React checkin on June 5, we&#39;ve somehow managed to accumulate 23500 lines of jsx (React-flavored js) code. Which is terrifying in a way - that&#39;s a lot of code - but also really exciting that it was picked up so quickly.</p>

<p>We held three meetings about how we should proceed with React. At the first two we decided to continue experimenting with React and deferred a final decision on whether to adopt it. At the third we adopted the policy that new code should be written in React.</p>

<p>I&#39;m excited that we were able to start nudging code quality forward. However, we still have a lot of work to do! One of the selling points of this transition is adopting a uniform frontend style. We&#39;re trying to upgrade all the code from (really old) pure jQuery and (regular old) Backbone views / Handlebars to shiny React. At the moment all we&#39;ve done is introduce more fragmentation. We won&#39;t be gratuitously updating working code (if it ain&#39;t broke, don&#39;t fix it), but are seeking out parts of the codebase where we can shoot two birds with one stone by rewriting in React while fixing bugs or adding functionality.</p>

<h2>React: Rethinking best practices</h2>

<h2>Server-side React with PHP</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.phpied.com/">Stoyan Stefanov</a>&#39;s series of articles on React has two new entries on how to execute React on the server to generate the initial page load.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This post is an initial hack to have React components render server-side in PHP.</p>

<ul>
<li>Problem: Build web UIs</li>
<li>Solution: React</li>
<li>Problem: UI built in JS is anti-SEO (assuming search engines are still noscript) and bad for perceived performance (blank page till JS arrives)</li>
<li>Solution: <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-page">React page</a> to render the first view</li>
<li>Problem: Can&#39;t host node.js apps / I have tons of PHP code</li>
<li>Solution: Use PHP then!</li>

<h2>TodoMVC Benchmarks</h2>

<p>Webkit has a <a href="https://github.com/WebKit/webkit/tree/master/PerformanceTests/DoYouEvenBench">TodoMVC Benchmark</a> that compares different frameworks. They recently included React and here are the results (average of 10 runs in Chrome 30):</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>AngularJS:</strong> 4043ms</li>
<li><strong>AngularJSPerf:</strong> 3227ms</li>
<li><strong>BackboneJS:</strong> 1874ms</li>
<li><strong>EmberJS:</strong> 6822ms</li>
<li><strong>jQuery:</strong> 14628ms</li>
<li><strong>React:</strong> 2864ms</li>
<li><strong>VanillaJS:</strong> 5567ms</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://www.petehunt.net/react/tastejs/benchmark.html">Try it yourself!</a></p>

<p>Please don&#39;t take those numbers too seriously, they only reflect one very specific use case and are testing code that wasn&#39;t written with performance in mind.</p>

<p>Even though React scores as one of the fastest frameworks in the benchmark, the React code is simple and idiomatic. The only performance tweak used is the following function:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="cm">/**</span>
<span class="cm"> * This is a completely optional performance enhancement that you can implement</span>
<span class="cm"> * on any React component. If you were to delete this method the app would still</span>
<span class="cm"> * work correctly (and still be very performant!), we just use it as an example</span>
<span class="cm"> * of how little code it takes to get an order of magnitude performance improvement.</span>
<span class="cm"> */</span>
<span class="nx">shouldComponentUpdate</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">nextProps</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">nextState</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="nx">nextProps</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">todo</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">id</span> <span class="o">!==</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">props</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">todo</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">id</span> <span class="o">||</span>
    <span class="nx">nextProps</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">todo</span> <span class="o">!==</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">props</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">todo</span> <span class="o">||</span>
    <span class="nx">nextProps</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">editing</span> <span class="o">!==</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">props</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">editing</span> <span class="o">||</span>
    <span class="nx">nextState</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">editText</span> <span class="o">!==</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">state</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">editText</span>
  <span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">},</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>By default, React &quot;re-renders&quot; all the components when anything changes. This is usually fast enough that you don&#39;t need to care. However, you can provide a function that can tell whether there will be any change based on the previous and next states and props. If it is faster than re-rendering the component, then you get a performance improvement.</p>

<p>The fact that you can control when components are rendered is a very important characteristic of React as it gives you control over its performance. We are going to talk more about performance in the future, stay tuned.</p>

<h2>Guess the filter</h2>

<p><a href="http://conr.me">Connor McSheffrey</a> implemented a small game using React. The goal is to guess which filter has been used to create the Instagram photo.

<h2>React vs FruitMachine</h2>

<p><a href="http://trib.tv/">Andrew Betts</a>, director of the <a href="http://labs.ft.com/">Financial Times Labs</a>, posted an article comparing <a href="https://github.com/ftlabs/fruitmachine">FruitMachine</a> and React.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Eerily similar, no? Maybe Facebook was inspired by Fruit Machine (after all, we got there first), but more likely, it just shows that this is a pretty decent way to solve the problem, and great minds think alike. We&#39;re graduating to a third phase in the evolution of web best practice - from intermingling of markup, style and behaviour, through a phase in which those concerns became ever more separated and encapsulated, and finally to a model where we can do that separation at a component level. Developments like Web Components show the direction the web community is moving, and frameworks like React and Fruit Machine are in fact not a lot more than polyfills for that promised behaviour to come.</p>

<p><a href="http://labs.ft.com/2013/10/client-side-layout-engines-react-vs-fruitmachine/">Read the full article...</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even though we weren&#39;t inspired by FruitMachine (React has been used in production since before FruitMachine was open sourced), it&#39;s great to see similar technologies emerging and becoming popular.</p>

<h2>React Brunch</h2>

<p><a href="http://elucidata.net/">Matthew McCray</a> implemented <a href="https://npmjs.org/package/react-brunch">react-brunch</a>, a JSX compilation step for <a href="http://brunch.io/">Brunch</a>.</p>

<div class="post">
  <p>This release is the result of several months of hard work from members of the team and the community. While there are no groundbreaking changes in core, we&#39;ve worked hard to improve performance and memory usage. We&#39;ve also worked hard to make sure we are being consistent in our usage of DOM properties.</p>

<p>The biggest change you&#39;ll notice as a developer is that we no longer support <code>class</code> in JSX as a way to provide CSS classes. Since this prop was being converted to <code>className</code> at the transform step, it caused some confusion when trying to access it in composite components. As a result we decided to make our DOM properties mirror their counterparts in the JS DOM API. There are <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/src/dom/DefaultDOMPropertyConfig.js#L156">a few exceptions</a> where we deviate slightly in an attempt to be consistent internally.</p>

<p>The other major change in v0.5 is that we&#39;ve added an additional build - <code>react-with-addons</code> - which adds support for some extras that we&#39;ve been working on including animations and two-way binding. <a href="/react/docs/addons.html">Read more about these addons in the docs</a>.</p>

<h2>Thanks to Our Community</h2>

<p>We added <em>22 new people</em> to the list of authors since we launched React v0.4.1 nearly 3 months ago. With a total of 48 names in our <code>AUTHORS</code> file, that means we&#39;ve nearly doubled the number of contributors in that time period. We&#39;ve seen the number of people contributing to discussion on IRC, mailing lists, Stack Overflow, and GitHub continue rising. We&#39;ve also had people tell us about talks they&#39;ve given in their local community about React.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been awesome to see the things that people are building with React, and we can&#39;t wait to see what you come up with next!</p>

<h2>Changelog</h2>

<h3>React</h3>

<ul>
<li>Memory usage improvements - reduced allocations in core which will help with GC pauses</li>
<li>Performance improvements - in addition to speeding things up, we made some tweaks to stay out of slow path code in V8 and Nitro.</li>
<li>Standardized prop -&gt; DOM attribute process. This previously resulting in additional type checking and overhead as well as confusing cases for users. Now we will always convert your value to a string before inserting it into the DOM.</li>
<li>Support for Selection events.</li>
<li>Support for <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CompositionEvent">Composition events</a>.</li>
<li>Support for additional DOM properties (<code>charSet</code>, <code>content</code>, <code>form</code>, <code>httpEquiv</code>, <code>rowSpan</code>, <code>autoCapitalize</code>).</li>
<li>Support for additional SVG properties (<code>rx</code>, <code>ry</code>).</li>
<li>Support for using <code>getInitialState</code> and <code>getDefaultProps</code> in mixins.</li>
<li>Support mounting into iframes.</li>
<li>Bug fixes for controlled form components.</li>
<li>Bug fixes for SVG element creation.</li>
<li>Added <code>React.version</code>.</li>
<li>Added <code>React.isValidClass</code> - Used to determine if a value is a valid component constructor.</li>
<li>Removed <code>React.autoBind</code> - This was deprecated in v0.4 and now properly removed.</li>
<li>Renamed  <code>React.unmountAndReleaseReactRootNode</code> to <code>React.unmountComponentAtNode</code>.</li>
<li>Began laying down work for refined performance analysis.</li>
<li>Better support for server-side rendering - <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-page">react-page</a> has helped improve the stability for server-side rendering.</li>
<li>Made it possible to use React in environments enforcing a strict <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Security/CSP/Introducing_Content_Security_Policy">Content Security Policy</a>. This also makes it possible to use React to build Chrome extensions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>React with Addons (New!)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Introduced a separate build with several &quot;addons&quot; which we think can help improve the React experience. We plan to deprecate this in the long-term, instead shipping each as standalone pieces. <a href="/react/docs/addons.html">Read more in the docs</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>JSX</h3>

<ul>
<li>No longer transform <code>class</code> to <code>className</code> as part of the transform! This is a breaking change - if you were using <code>class</code>, you <em>must</em> change this to <code>className</code> or your components will be visually broken.</li>
<li>Added warnings to the in-browser transformer to make it clear it is not intended for production use.</li>
<li>Improved compatibility for Windows</li>
<li>Improved support for maintaining line numbers when transforming.</li>
</ul>
