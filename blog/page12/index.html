         <p>The highlight of this week is that an interaction-heavy app has been ported to React. React components are solving issues they had with nested views.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" name="moving-from-backbone-to-react"></a>Moving From Backbone To React <a class="hash-link" href="#moving-from-backbone-to-react">#</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/clayallsopp">Clay Allsopp</a> successfully ported <a href="http://usepropeller.com/blog/posts/from-backbone-to-react/">Propeller</a>, a fairly big, interaction-heavy JavaScript app, to React.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://usepropeller.com/blog/posts/from-backbone-to-react/"><img style="float: right; margin: 0 0 10px 10px;" src="/react/img/blog/propeller-logo.png" /></a>Subviews involve a lot of easy-to-forget boilerplate that Backbone (by design) doesn&#39;t automate. Libraries like Backbone.Marionette offer more abstractions to make view nesting easier, but they&#39;re all limited by the fact that Backbone delegates how and went view-document attachment occurs to the application code.</p>

<p>React, on the other hand, manages the DOM and only exposes real nodes at select points in its API. The &quot;elements&quot; you code in React are actually objects which wrap DOM nodes, not the actual objects which get inserted into the DOM. Internally, React converts those abstractions into actual DOMElements and fills out the document accordingly. [...]</p>

<p>We moved about 20 different Backbone view classes to React over the past few weeks, including the live-preview pane that you see in our little iOS demo. Most importantly, it&#39;s allowed us to put energy into making each component work great on its own, instead of spending extra cycles to ensure they function in unison. For that reason, we think React is a more scalable way to build view-intensive apps than Backbone alone, and it doesn&#39;t require you to drop-everything-and-refactor like a move to Ember or Angular would demand.</p>

<h2><a class="anchor" name="backbonehandlebars-nested-views"></a>Backbone/Handlebars Nested Views <a class="hash-link" href="#backbonehandlebars-nested-views">#</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://joelburget.com/">Joel Burget</a> wrote a blog post talking about the way we would write React-like components in Backbone and Handlebars.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The problem here is that we&#39;re trying to maniplate a tree, but there&#39;s a textual layer we have to go through. Our views are represented as a tree - the subviews are children of CommentCollectionView - and they end up as part of a tree in the DOM. But there&#39;s a Handlebars layer in the middle (which deals in flat strings), so the hierarchy must be destructed and rebuilt when we render.</p>

<p>What does it take to render a collection view? In the Backbone/Handlebars view of the world you have to render the template (with stubs), render each subview which replaces a stub, and keep a reference to each subview (or anything within the view that could change in the future).</p>

<p>So while our view is conceptually hierarchical, due to the fact that it has to go through a flat textual representation, we need to do a lot of extra work to reassemble that structure after rendering.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve seen a lot of people comparing React with various frameworks. <a href="http://ricardo.cc/">Ricardo Tomasi</a> decided to re-implement the tutorial without any framework, just plain Javascript.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Facebook &amp; Instagram launched the React framework and an accompanying tutorial. Developer Vlad Yazhbin decided to rewrite that using AngularJS.

<p><a href="http://www.andrewgreig.com/">Andrew Greig</a> made a blog post that gives a high level description of what React is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have been using Facebooks recently released Javascript framework called React.js for the last few days and have managed to obtain a rather high level understanding of how it works and formed a good perspective on how it fits in to the entire javascript framework ecosystem.</p>

<p>Basically, React is not an MVC framework. It is not a replacement for Backbone or Knockout or Angular, instead it is designed to work with existing frameworks and help extend their functionality.</p>

<p>It is designed for building big UIs. The type where you have lots of reusable components that are handling events and presenting and changing some backend data. In a traditional MVC app, React fulfils the role of the View. So you would still need to handle the Model and Controller on your own.</p>

<p>I found the best way to utilise React was to pair it with Backbone, with React replacing the Backbone View, or to write your own Model/Data object and have React communicate with that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To set the record straight: React components are far more powerful than Angular templates; they should be compared with Angular&#39;s directives instead. So I took the first Google hit for &quot;AngularJS directive tutorial&quot; (AngularJS Directives Tutorial - Fundoo Solutions), rewrote it in React and compared them. [...]</p>

<p>We&#39;ve designed React from the beginning to work well with other libraries. Angular is no exception. Let&#39;s take the original Angular example and use React to implement the fundoo-rating directive.</p>

<p>React has some interesting concepts for JavaScript view objects that can be used to eliminate this one big problem I have with Backbone.js.</p>

<p>As in most MVC implementations (although React is probably just a VC implementation), a view is one portion of the screen that is managed by a controlling object. This object is responsible for deciding when to re-render the view and how to react to user input. With React, these view-controllers objects are called components. A component knows how to render its view and how to handle to the user&#39;s interaction with it.</p>

<p>The interesting thing is that React is figuring out by itself when to re-render a view and how to do this in the most efficient way.</p>

<p>I recently stumbled upon facebook&#39;s React library, which is a Javascript library for building reusable frontend components. Even if this lib is only at version 0.3.x it behaves very stable, it is fast and is fun to code. I&#39;m a big fan of require.js, so I tried to use React within the require.js eco system. It was not as hard as expected and here are some examples and some thoughts about it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.petehunt.net/blog/">Pete Hunt</a> explained what differentiates React from other JavaScript libraries in <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2013/06/05/why-react.html">a previous blog post</a>. <a href="http://leebyron.com/">Lee Byron</a> gives another perspective on Quora:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>React isn&#39;t quite like any other popular Javascript libraries, and it solves a very specific problem: complex UI rendering. It&#39;s also intended to be used along side many other popular libraries. For example, React works well with Backbone.js, amongst many others.</p>

<p>React was born out of frustrations with the common pattern of writing two-way data bindings in complex MVC apps. React is an implementation of one-way data bindings.</p>

        <div class="post">
         <p>There are a lot of JavaScript MVC frameworks out there. Why did we build React
and why would you want to use it?</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" name="react-isnt-an-mvc-framework."></a>React isn&#39;t an MVC framework. <a class="hash-link" href="#react-isnt-an-mvc-framework.">#</a></h2>
<p>React is a library for building composable user interfaces. It encourages
the creation of reusable UI components which present data that changes over
time.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" name="react-doesnt-use-templates."></a>React doesn&#39;t use templates. <a class="hash-link" href="#react-doesnt-use-templates.">#</a></h2>
<p>Traditionally, web application UIs are built using templates or HTML directives.
These templates dictate the full set of abstractions that you are allowed to use
to build your UI.</p>

<p>React approaches building user interfaces differently by breaking them into
<strong>components</strong>. This means React uses a real, full featured programming language
to render views, which we see as an advantage over templates for a few reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>JavaScript is a flexible, powerful programming language</strong> with the ability
to build abstractions. This is incredibly important in large applications.</li>
<li>By unifying your markup with its corresponding view logic, React can actually
make views <strong>easier to extend and maintain</strong>.</li>
<li>By baking an understanding of markup and content into JavaScript, there&#39;s
<strong>no manual string concatenation</strong> and therefore less surface area for XSS
vulnerabilities.</li>
</ul>

<p>We&#39;ve also created <a href="/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html">JSX</a>, an optional syntax
extension, in case you prefer the readability of HTML to raw JavaScript.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" name="reactive-updates-are-dead-simple."></a>Reactive updates are dead simple. <a class="hash-link" href="#reactive-updates-are-dead-simple.">#</a></h2>
<p>React really shines when your data changes over time.</p>

<p>In a traditional JavaScript application, you need to look at what data changed
and imperatively make changes to the DOM to keep it up-to-date. Even AngularJS,
which provides a declarative interface via directives and data binding <a href="http://code.angularjs.org/1.0.8/docs/guide/directive#reasonsbehindthecompilelinkseparation">requires
a linking function to manually update DOM nodes</a>.</p>

<p>React takes a different approach.</p>

<p>When your component is first initialized, the <code>render</code> method is called,
generating a lightweight representation of your view. From that representation,
a string of markup is produced, and injected into the document. When your data
changes, the <code>render</code> method is called again. In order to perform updates as
efficiently as possible, we diff the return value from the previous call to
<code>render</code> with the new one, and generate a minimal set of changes to be applied
to the DOM.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The data returned from <code>render</code> is neither a string nor a DOM node -- it&#39;s a
lightweight description of what the DOM should look like.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We call this process <strong>reconciliation</strong>. Check out
<a href="http://jsfiddle.net/fv6RD/3/">this jsFiddle</a> to see an example of
reconciliation in action.</p>

<p>Because this re-render is so fast (around 1ms for TodoMVC), the developer
doesn&#39;t need to explicitly specify data bindings. We&#39;ve found this approach
makes it easier to build apps.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" name="html-is-just-the-beginning."></a>HTML is just the beginning. <a class="hash-link" href="#html-is-just-the-beginning.">#</a></h2>
<p>Because React has its own lightweight representation of the document, we can do
some pretty cool things with it:</p>

<ul>
<li>Facebook has dynamic charts that render to <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> instead of HTML.</li>
<li>Instagram is a &quot;single page&quot; web app built entirely with React and
<code>Backbone.Router</code>. Designers regularly contribute React code with JSX.</li>
<li>We&#39;ve built internal prototypes that run React apps in a web worker and use
React to drive <strong>native iOS views</strong> via an Objective-C bridge.</li>
<li>You can run React
<a href="http://github.com/petehunt/react-server-rendering-example">on the server</a>
for SEO, performance, code sharing and overall flexibility.</li>
<li>Events behave in a consistent, standards-compliant way in all browsers
(including IE8) and automatically use
<a href="http://davidwalsh.name/event-delegate">event delegation</a>.</li>
</ul>

built. Our documentation is geared towards building apps with the framework,
