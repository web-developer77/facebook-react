         <p>This is the 10th round-up already and React has come quite far since it was open sourced. Almost all new web projects at Khan Academy, Facebook, and Instagram are being developed using React. React has been deployed in a variety of contexts: a Chrome extension, a Windows 8 application, mobile websites, and desktop websites supporting Internet Explorer 8! Language-wise, React is not only being used within JavaScript but also CoffeeScript and ClojureScript.</p>

<p>The best part is that no drastic changes have been required to support all those use cases. Most of the efforts were targeted at polishing edge cases, performance improvements, and documentation.</p>
<h2 id="khan-academy---officially-moving-to-react" class="anchor"><a href="#khan-academy---officially-moving-to-react">Khan Academy - Officially moving to React</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://joelburget.com/">Joel Burget</a> announced at Hack Reactor that new front-end code at Khan Academy should be written in React!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How did we get the rest of the team to adopt React? Using interns as an attack vector! Most full-time devs had already been working on their existing projects for a while and weren&#39;t looking to try something new at the time, but our class of summer interns was just arriving. For whatever reason, a lot of them decided to try React for their projects. Then mentors became exposed through code reviews or otherwise touching the new code. In this way React knowledge diffused to almost the whole team over the summer.</p>

<p>Since the first React checkin on June 5, we&#39;ve somehow managed to accumulate 23500 lines of jsx (React-flavored js) code. Which is terrifying in a way - that&#39;s a lot of code - but also really exciting that it was picked up so quickly.</p>

<p>We held three meetings about how we should proceed with React. At the first two we decided to continue experimenting with React and deferred a final decision on whether to adopt it. At the third we adopted the policy that new code should be written in React.</p>

<p>I&#39;m excited that we were able to start nudging code quality forward. However, we still have a lot of work to do! One of the selling points of this transition is adopting a uniform frontend style. We&#39;re trying to upgrade all the code from (really old) pure jQuery and (regular old) Backbone views / Handlebars to shiny React. At the moment all we&#39;ve done is introduce more fragmentation. We won&#39;t be gratuitously updating working code (if it ain&#39;t broke, don&#39;t fix it), but are seeking out parts of the codebase where we can shoot two birds with one stone by rewriting in React while fixing bugs or adding functionality.</p>

<h2 id="todomvc-benchmarks" class="anchor"><a href="#todomvc-benchmarks">TodoMVC Benchmarks</a></h2>
<p>Webkit has a <a href="https://github.com/WebKit/webkit/tree/master/PerformanceTests/DoYouEvenBench">TodoMVC Benchmark</a> that compares different frameworks. They recently included React and here are the results (average of 10 runs in Chrome 30):</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>AngularJS:</strong> 4043ms</li>
<li><strong>AngularJSPerf:</strong> 3227ms</li>
<li><strong>BackboneJS:</strong> 1874ms</li>
<li><strong>EmberJS:</strong> 6822ms</li>
<li><strong>jQuery:</strong> 14628ms</li>
<li><strong>React:</strong> 2864ms</li>
<li><strong>VanillaJS:</strong> 5567ms</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://www.petehunt.net/react/tastejs/benchmark.html">Try it yourself!</a></p>

<p>Please don&#39;t take those numbers too seriously, they only reflect one very specific use case and are testing code that wasn&#39;t written with performance in mind.</p>

<p>Even though React scores as one of the fastest frameworks in the benchmark, the React code is simple and idiomatic. The only performance tweak used is the following function:</p>

<p>By default, React &quot;re-renders&quot; all the components when anything changes. This is usually fast enough that you don&#39;t need to care. However, you can provide a function that can tell whether there will be any change based on the previous and next states and props. If it is faster than re-rendering the component, then you get a performance improvement.</p>

<p>The fact that you can control when components are rendered is a very important characteristic of React as it gives you control over its performance. We are going to talk more about performance in the future, stay tuned.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Eerily similar, no? Maybe Facebook was inspired by Fruit Machine (after all, we got there first), but more likely, it just shows that this is a pretty decent way to solve the problem, and great minds think alike. We&#39;re graduating to a third phase in the evolution of web best practice - from intermingling of markup, style and behaviour, through a phase in which those concerns became ever more separated and encapsulated, and finally to a model where we can do that separation at a component level. Developments like Web Components show the direction the web community is moving, and frameworks like React and Fruit Machine are in fact not a lot more than polyfills for that promised behaviour to come.</p>

         <p>React is, in my opinion, the premier way to build big, fast Web apps with JavaScript. It&#39;s scaled very well for us at Facebook and Instagram.</p>

<p>One of the many great parts of React is how it makes you think about apps as you build them. In this post I&#39;ll walk you through the thought process of building a searchable product data table using React.</p>
<h2 id="start-with-a-mock" class="anchor"><a href="#start-with-a-mock">Start with a mock</a></h2>
<p>Imagine that we already have a JSON API and a mock from our designer. Our designer apparently isn&#39;t very good because the mock looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="/react/img/blog/thinking-in-react-mock.png" alt="Mockup"></p>

<p>Our JSON API returns some data that looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">[
  {category: &quot;Sporting Goods&quot;, price: &quot;$49.99&quot;, stocked: true, name: &quot;Football&quot;},
  {category: &quot;Sporting Goods&quot;, price: &quot;$9.99&quot;, stocked: true, name: &quot;Baseball&quot;},
  {category: &quot;Sporting Goods&quot;, price: &quot;$29.99&quot;, stocked: false, name: &quot;Basketball&quot;},
  {category: &quot;Electronics&quot;, price: &quot;$99.99&quot;, stocked: true, name: &quot;iPod Touch&quot;},
  {category: &quot;Electronics&quot;, price: &quot;$399.99&quot;, stocked: false, name: &quot;iPhone 5&quot;},
  {category: &quot;Electronics&quot;, price: &quot;$199.99&quot;, stocked: true, name: &quot;Nexus 7&quot;}

<p>The first thing you&#39;ll want to do is to draw boxes around every component (and subcomponent) in the mock and give them all names. If you&#39;re working with a designer they may have already done this, so go talk to them! Their Photoshop layer names may end up being the names of your React components!</p>

<p>But how do you know what should be its own component? Just use the same techniques for deciding if you should create a new function or object. One such technique is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle">single responsibility principle</a>, that is, a component should ideally only do one thing. If it ends up growing it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents.</p>

<p>Since you&#39;re often displaying a JSON data model to a user, you&#39;ll find that if your model was built correctly your UI (and therefore your component structure) will map nicely onto it. That&#39;s because user interfaces and data models tend to adhere to the same <em>information architecture</em> which means the work of separating your UI into components is often trivial. Just break it up into components that represent exactly one piece of your data model.</p>

<p><img src="/react/img/blog/thinking-in-react-components.png" alt="Component diagram"></p>

<p>You&#39;ll see here that we have five components in our simple app. I&#39;ve italicized the data each component represents.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong><code>FilterableProductTable</code> (orange):</strong> contains the entirety of the example</li>
<li><strong><code>SearchBar</code> (blue):</strong> receives all <em>user input</em></li>
<li><strong><code>ProductTable</code> (green):</strong> displays and filters the <em>data collection</em> based on <em>user input</em></li>
<li><strong><code>ProductCategoryRow</code> (turquoise):</strong> displays a heading for each <em>category</em></li>
<li><strong><code>ProductRow</code> (red):</strong> displays a row for each <em>product</em></li>
</ol>

<p>If you look at <code>ProductTable</code> you&#39;ll see that the table header (containing the &quot;Name&quot; and &quot;Price&quot; labels) isn&#39;t its own component. This is a matter of preference and there&#39;s an argument to be made either way. For this example I left it as part of <code>ProductTable</code> because it is part of rendering the <em>data collection</em> which is <code>ProductTable</code>&#39;s responsibility. However if this header grows to be complex (i.e. if we were to add affordances for sorting) it would certainly make sense to make this its own <code>ProductTableHeader</code> component.</p>

<p>Now that we&#39;ve identified the components in our mock, let&#39;s arrange them into a hierarchy. This is easy. Components that appear within another component in the mock should appear as a child in the hierarchy:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>FilterableProductTable</code>

<ul>
<li><code>SearchBar</code></li>
<li><code>ProductTable</code>

<ul>
<li><code>ProductCategoryRow</code></li>
<li><code>ProductRow</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="step-2-build-a-static-version-in-react" class="anchor"><a href="#step-2-build-a-static-version-in-react">Step 2: Build a static version in React</a></h2>
<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="http://jsfiddle.net/6wQMG/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>Now that you have your component hierarchy it&#39;s time to start implementing your app. The easiest way is to build a version that takes your data model and renders the UI but has no interactivity. It&#39;s easiest to decouple these processes because building building a static version requires a lot of typing and no thinking, and adding interactivity requires a lot of thinking and not a lot of typing. We&#39;ll see why.</p>

<p>To build a static version of your app that renders your data model you&#39;ll want to build components that reuse other components and pass data using <em>props</em>. <em>props</em> are a way of passing data from parent to child. If you&#39;re familiar with the concept of <em>state</em>, <strong>don&#39;t use state at all</strong> to build this static version. State is reserved only for interactivity, that is, data that changes over time. Since this is a static version of the app you don&#39;t need it.</p>

<p>You can build top-down or bottom-up. That is, you can either start with building the components higher up in the hierarchy (i.e. starting with <code>FilterableProductTable</code>) or with the ones lower in it (<code>ProductRow</code>). In simpler examples it&#39;s usually easier to go top-down and on larger projects it&#39;s easier to go bottom-up and write tests as you build.</p>

<p>At the end of this step you&#39;ll have a library of reusable components that render your data model. The components will only have <code>render()</code> methods since this is a static version of your app. The component at the top of the hierarchy (<code>FilterableProductTable</code>) will take your data model as a prop. If you make a change to your underlying data model and call <code>renderComponent()</code> again the UI will be updated. It&#39;s easy to see how your UI is updated and where to make changes since there&#39;s nothing complicated going on since React&#39;s <strong>one-way data flow</strong> (also called <em>one-way binding</em>) keeps everything modular, easy to reason about, and fast.</p>

<p>Simply refer to the <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/">React docs</a> if you need help executing this step.</p>
<h3 id="a-brief-interlude-props-vs-state" class="anchor"><a href="#a-brief-interlude-props-vs-state">A brief interlude: props vs state</a></h3>
<p>There are two types of &quot;model&quot; data in React: props and state. It&#39;s important to understand the distinction between the two; skim <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/interactivity-and-dynamic-uis.html">the official React docs</a> if you aren&#39;t sure what the difference is.</p>
<h2 id="step-3-identify-the-minimal-but-complete-representation-of-ui-state" class="anchor"><a href="#step-3-identify-the-minimal-but-complete-representation-of-ui-state">Step 3: Identify the minimal (but complete) representation of UI state</a></h2>
<p>To make your UI interactive you need to be able to trigger changes to your underlying data model. React makes this easy with <strong>state</strong>.</p>

<p>To build your app correctly you first need to think of the minimal set of mutable state that your app needs. The key here is DRY: <em>Don&#39;t Repeat Yourself</em>. Figure out what the absolute minimal representation of the state of your application needs to be and compute everything else you need on-demand. For example, if you&#39;re building a TODO list, just keep an array of the TODO items around; don&#39;t keep a separate state variable for the count. Instead, when you want to render the TODO count simply take the length of the TODO items array.</p>

<p>Think of all of the pieces of data in our example application. We have:</p>

<ul>
<li>The original list of products</li>
<li>The search text the user has entered</li>
<li>The value of the checkbox</li>
<li>The filtered list of products</li>
</ul>

<p>Let&#39;s go through each one and figure out which one is state. Simply ask three questions about each piece of data:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn&#39;t state.</li>
<li>Does it change over time? If not, it probably isn&#39;t state.</li>
<li>Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it&#39;s not state.</li>
</ol>

<p>The original list of products is passed in as props, so that&#39;s not state. The search text and the checkbox seem to be state since they change over time and can&#39;t be computed from anything. And finally, the filtered list of products isn&#39;t state because it can be computed by combining the original list of products with the search text and value of the checkbox.</p>

<p>So finally, our state is:</p>

<p>OK, so we&#39;ve identified what the minimal set of app state is. Next we need to identify which component mutates, or <em>owns</em>, this state.</p>

<p>Remember: React is all about one-way data flow down the component hierarchy. It may not be immediately clear which component should own what state. <strong>This is often the most challenging part for newcomers to understand,</strong> so follow these steps to figure it out:</p>

<p>For each piece of state in your application:</p>

<ul>
<li>Identify every component that renders something based on that state.</li>
<li>Find a common owner component (a single component above all the components that need the state in the hierarchy).</li>
<li>Either the common owner or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state.</li>
<li>If you can&#39;t find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component simply for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common owner component.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let&#39;s run through this strategy for our application:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>ProductTable</code> needs to filter the product list based on state and <code>SearchBar</code> needs to display the search text and checked state.</li>
<li>The common owner component is <code>FilterableProductTable</code>.</li>
<li>It conceptually makes sense for the filter text and checked value to live in <code>FilterableProductTable</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Cool, so we&#39;ve decided that our state lives in <code>FilterableProductTable</code>. First, add a <code>getInitialState()</code> method to <code>FilterableProductTable</code> that returns <code>{filterText: &#39;&#39;, inStockOnly: false}</code> to reflect the initial state of your application. Then pass <code>filterText</code> and <code>inStockOnly</code> to <code>ProductTable</code> and <code>SearchBar</code> as a prop. Finally, use these props to filter the rows in <code>ProductTable</code> and set the values of the form fields in <code>SearchBar</code>.</p>

<p>You can start seeing how your application will behave: set <code>filterText</code> to <code>&quot;ball&quot;</code> and refresh your app. You&#39;ll see the data table is updated correctly.</p>
<h2 id="step-5-add-inverse-data-flow" class="anchor"><a href="#step-5-add-inverse-data-flow">Step 5: Add inverse data flow</a></h2>
<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="http://jsfiddle.net/3Vs3Q/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>So far we&#39;ve built an app that renders correctly as a function of props and state flowing down the hierarchy. Now it&#39;s time to support data flowing the other way: the form components deep in the hierarchy need to update the state in <code>FilterableProductTable</code>.</p>

<p>React makes this data flow explicit to make it easy to understand how your program works, but it does require a little more typing than traditional two-way data binding. React provides an add-on called <code>ReactLink</code> to make this pattern as convenient as two-way binding, but for the purpose of this post we&#39;ll keep everything explicit.</p>

<p>If you try to type or check the box in the current version of the example you&#39;ll see that React ignores your input. This is intentional, as we&#39;ve set the <code>value</code> prop of the <code>input</code> to always be equal to the <code>state</code> passed in from <code>FilterableProductTable</code>.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s think about what we want to happen. We want to make sure that whenever the user changes the form we update the state to reflect the user input. Since components should only update their own state, <code>FilterableProductTable</code> will pass a callback to <code>SearchBar</code> that will fire whenever the state should be updated. We can use the <code>onChange</code> event on the inputs to be notified of it. And the callback passed by <code>FilterableProductTable</code> will call <code>setState()</code> and the app will be updated.</p>

<p>Though this sounds like a lot it&#39;s really just a few lines of code. And it&#39;s really explicit how your data is flowing throughout the app.</p>
<h2 id="and-thats-it" class="anchor"><a href="#and-thats-it">And that&#39;s it</a></h2>
<p>Hopefully this gives you an idea of how to think about building components and applications with React. While it may be a little more typing than you&#39;re used to, remember that code is read far more than it&#39;s written, and it&#39;s extremely easy to read this modular, explicit code. As you start to build large libraries of components you&#39;ll appreciate this explicitness and modularity, and with code reuse your lines of code will start to shrink :)</p>

         <p>This release is the result of several months of hard work from members of the team and the community. While there are no groundbreaking changes in core, we&#39;ve worked hard to improve performance and memory usage. We&#39;ve also worked hard to make sure we are being consistent in our usage of DOM properties.</p>

<p>The biggest change you&#39;ll notice as a developer is that we no longer support <code>class</code> in JSX as a way to provide CSS classes. Since this prop was being converted to <code>className</code> at the transform step, it caused some confusion when trying to access it in composite components. As a result we decided to make our DOM properties mirror their counterparts in the JS DOM API. There are <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/src/dom/DefaultDOMPropertyConfig.js#L156">a few exceptions</a> where we deviate slightly in an attempt to be consistent internally.</p>

<p>The other major change in v0.5 is that we&#39;ve added an additional build - <code>react-with-addons</code> - which adds support for some extras that we&#39;ve been working on including animations and two-way binding. <a href="/react/docs/addons.html">Read more about these addons in the docs</a>.</p>
<h2 id="thanks-to-our-community" class="anchor"><a href="#thanks-to-our-community">Thanks to Our Community</a></h2>
<p>We added <em>22 new people</em> to the list of authors since we launched React v0.4.1 nearly 3 months ago. With a total of 48 names in our <code>AUTHORS</code> file, that means we&#39;ve nearly doubled the number of contributors in that time period. We&#39;ve seen the number of people contributing to discussion on IRC, mailing lists, Stack Overflow, and GitHub continue rising. We&#39;ve also had people tell us about talks they&#39;ve given in their local community about React.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been awesome to see the things that people are building with React, and we can&#39;t wait to see what you come up with next!</p>
<h2 id="changelog" class="anchor"><a href="#changelog">Changelog</a></h2><h3 id="react" class="anchor"><a href="#react">React</a></h3>
<ul>

<li>Support for Selection events.</li>
<li>Support for <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CompositionEvent">Composition events</a>.</li>
<li>Support for additional DOM properties (<code>charSet</code>, <code>content</code>, <code>form</code>, <code>httpEquiv</code>, <code>rowSpan</code>, <code>autoCapitalize</code>).</li>
<li>Support for additional SVG properties (<code>rx</code>, <code>ry</code>).</li>
<li>Support for using <code>getInitialState</code> and <code>getDefaultProps</code> in mixins.</li>
<li>Support mounting into iframes.</li>
<li>Bug fixes for controlled form components.</li>

<li>Added <code>React.version</code>.</li>
<li>Added <code>React.isValidClass</code> - Used to determine if a value is a valid component constructor.</li>
<li>Removed <code>React.autoBind</code> - This was deprecated in v0.4 and now properly removed.</li>
<li>Renamed  <code>React.unmountAndReleaseReactRootNode</code> to <code>React.unmountComponentAtNode</code>.</li>
<li>Began laying down work for refined performance analysis.</li>
<li>Better support for server-side rendering - <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-page">react-page</a> has helped improve the stability for server-side rendering.</li>
<li>Made it possible to use React in environments enforcing a strict <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Security/CSP/Introducing_Content_Security_Policy">Content Security Policy</a>. This also makes it possible to use React to build Chrome extensions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="react-with-addons-new" class="anchor"><a href="#react-with-addons-new">React with Addons (New!)</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Introduced a separate build with several &quot;addons&quot; which we think can help improve the React experience. We plan to deprecate this in the long-term, instead shipping each as standalone pieces. <a href="/react/docs/addons.html">Read more in the docs</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="jsx" class="anchor"><a href="#jsx">JSX</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>No longer transform <code>class</code> to <code>className</code> as part of the transform! This is a breaking change - if you were using <code>class</code>, you <em>must</em> change this to <code>className</code> or your components will be visually broken.</li>
<li>Added warnings to the in-browser transformer to make it clear it is not intended for production use.</li>
<li>Improved compatibility for Windows</li>
<li>Improved support for maintaining line numbers when transforming.</li>

         <p>We organized a React hackathon last week-end in the Facebook Seattle office. 50 people, grouped into 15 teams, came to hack for a day on React. It was a lot of fun and we&#39;ll probably organize more in the future.</p>

<p><a href="http://bold-it.com/">Alex Swan</a> implemented <a href="http://qu.izti.me/">Qu.izti.me</a>, a multi-player quiz game. It is real-time via Web Socket and mobile friendly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The game itself is pretty simple. People join the &quot;room&quot; by going to <a href="http://qu.izti.me/">http://qu.izti.me</a> on their device. Large displays will show a leaderboard along with the game, and small displays (such as phones) will act as personal gamepads. Users will see questions and a choice of answers. The faster you answer, the more points you earn.</p>

<p>In my opinion, Socket.io and React go together like chocolate and peanut butter. The page was always an accurate representation of the game object.

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Re-request this page&quot; is just a link to the current page. When you click it, Turbolinks intercepts the GET request and fetchs the full page via XHR.</p>

<p>The panel is rendered with a random panel- class on each request, and the progress bar gets a random widthX class.</p>

<p>With Turbolinks alone, the entire <body> would be replaced, and transitions would not happen. In this little demo though, React adds and removes classes and text, and the attribute changes are animated with CSS transitions. The DOM is otherwise left intact.
